The notary services in the real world, like a notary public verification, are highly useful to provide independent verification of important documents. Having a document notarized with a notary Public's seal is the same as swearing under oath in court - you're attesting that the facts contained in the document are true.

## What is traditionally needed for a document to be notarized?

To have a document marked with the notary public's seal, you will need to do the following:

* Two pieces of identification (government issued photo ID and another one with at least your name)
* Verbal agreement in front of the notary that you understand and can attest to the facts of the document
* Signing the document with the notary as a witness
* The notary will then affix their stamp to the document
* The document is now notarized

## Blockchain technology

Bitcoin ushered in the breakthrough technology of the blockchain. For many years the problem was to **establish trust between two parties** without an independent, reputable third party present. This was a roadblock for many industries and there was always a need to have a centralized middleman, waiving fees for their service as a witness (think Uber, AirBnB, notary services).

One of the core functionalities of the blockchain involves **historical immutability** -- the inability to change past records once they've been verified. This breakthrough solution in the digital space has immense value and it is beginning to propagate across many industries. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to build a notary system using NEM blockchain features to timestamp and verify notarizations.
