In this workshop you have reviewed some NEM blockchain features by architecting a notarization system. Remember how to creatively combine NEM accounts so that you can create a complete blockchain solution.

If you want to learn how to combine other NEM built-in features, [visit the NEM Developer Center](https://nemtech.github.io/) or continue with [NEM applied to supply chain workshop](https://nemtech.github.io/nem2-workshop-nem-applied-to-supply-chain/lessons/prepare-your-workstation/).

## Apostille library

If you are willing to code some notarization system, review the [Apostille library](https://apostille.io). The library enables transferable, updatable, and conjointly owned notarizations on NEM, agreeing in a common way to read the blockchain.
